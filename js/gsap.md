### GSAP and ScrollTrigger Registration
```javascript
gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger);
```
This line registers the `ScrollTrigger` plugin with GSAP, making its functionalities available for use. ScrollTrigger allows you to create scroll-driven animations.

### Selecting Elements
```javascript
let panelsSection = document.querySelector("#panels"),
    panelsContainer = document.querySelector("#panels-container"),
    tween;
```
These lines select the HTML elements with the IDs `panels` and `panels-container`. `panelsSection` represents the section containing all panels, and `panelsContainer` is the container holding all the individual panels. `tween` will be used later to store the GSAP animation instance.

### Selecting Panels and Creating Animation
```javascript
const panels = gsap.utils.toArray("#panels-container .panel");
```
This line uses `gsap.utils.toArray` to select all elements with the class `panel` inside `#panels-container` and converts the NodeList to an array. This makes it easier to work with GSAP animations.

```javascript
tween = gsap.to(panels, {
    xPercent: -100 * (panels.length - 1),
    ease: "none",
    scrollTrigger: {
        trigger: "#panels",
        pin: true,
        scrub: 1,
        snap: {
            snapTo: 1 / (panels.length - 1),
            duration: { min: 0.2, max: 0.3 },
            ease: "power1.inOut"
        },
        end: () => "+=" + panelsContainer.offsetWidth
    }
});
```
1. **`gsap.to(panels, {...})`:** Creates a GSAP tween (animation) that will animate the `xPercent` property of each panel in the `panels` array. The `xPercent` property shifts the element horizontally based on its width.
2. **`xPercent: -100 * (panels.length - 1)`:** Animates the horizontal position of the panels to create a sliding effect. If there are 5 panels, the `xPercent` will be -400, moving the container 400% to the left.
3. **`ease: "none"`:** Sets the easing to "none", making the animation linear (no acceleration or deceleration).
4. **`scrollTrigger: {...}`:** Configures ScrollTrigger options:
   - **`trigger: "#panels"`:** Defines the element that triggers the scroll animation.
   - **`pin: true`:** Pins the `#panels` section in place during the scroll animation.
   - **`scrub: 1`:** Syncs the animation to the scrollbar position with a 1-second smoothness.
   - **`snap: {...}`:** Configures snapping behavior:
     - **`snapTo: 1 / (panels.length - 1)`:** Defines the snapping points based on the number of panels.
     - **`duration: { min: 0.2, max: 0.3 }`:** Sets the minimum and maximum snap durations.
     - **`ease: "power1.inOut"`:** Eases the snap with a smooth in-and-out transition.
   - **`end: () => "+=" + panelsContainer.offsetWidth`:** Sets the end point of the ScrollTrigger based on the width of the panels container, allowing for the correct scroll length.

### Ensuring Normal Scrolling After Panels
```javascript
ScrollTrigger.create({
    trigger: "#map",
    start: "top top",
    end: "bottom bottom",
    pin: false,
    pinSpacing: true,
    scrub: false
});
```
This `ScrollTrigger.create` ensures that the normal scrolling behavior resumes after the panels section:
1. **`trigger: "#map"`:** Defines the element that triggers this ScrollTrigger instance.
2. **`start: "top top"`:** Specifies the start point of the trigger (top of the `#map` element at the top of the viewport).
3. **`end: "bottom bottom"`:** Specifies the end point (bottom of the `#map` element at the bottom of the viewport).
4. **`pin: false`:** Indicates that this element should not be pinned.
5. **`pinSpacing: true`:** Adds spacing for the pin (though it is not pinned here, this is a default setting).
6. **`scrub: false`:** Disables scrubbing, meaning the scroll position does not control the animation.

### Panel Navigation Handling
```javascript
document.querySelectorAll('.nav-panel a').forEach(anchor => {
    anchor.addEventListener('click', function(e) {
        e.preventDefault();
        gsap.to(window, {duration: 1, scrollTo: this.getAttribute('href')});
    });
});
```
This part handles the navigation within the panels:
1. **`document.querySelectorAll('.nav-panel a')`:** Selects all anchor (`<a>`) elements within elements having the class `nav-panel`.
2. **`.forEach(anchor => {...})`:** Iterates over each selected anchor element.
3. **`anchor.addEventListener('click', function(e) {...})`:** Adds a click event listener to each anchor:
   - **`e.preventDefault()`:** Prevents the default anchor click behavior (jumping to the section).
   - **`gsap.to(window, {duration: 1, scrollTo: this.getAttribute('href')})`:** Uses GSAP to smoothly scroll to the target section referenced by the anchor's `href` attribute.

By understanding each line, you can adjust the script to suit your specific needs in future projects.
